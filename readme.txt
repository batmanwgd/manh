Warning: You must contact Kaska BEFORE attempting to make massive changes within this design system. Many parts are codependent and the code is not self sufficient if you are unsure of writing vanillaJS, AngularJS and if you do not share a brain similar to Kaska's. It's just easier to ask her first :)
